## MY LEARNING JOURNEY WITH DIGITAL SKILLS AFRICA 

## *Introduction*  

*My journey into the world of data analysis began when I applied to the Digital Skills Africa program with a strong desire to gain practical, in-demand skills in todayâ€™s data-driven world. Through this program, I have been equipped with essential tools and knowledge that are foundational to the role of a data analyst.
__As part of my training, I have gained hands-on experience with Microsoft Excel, mastering data entry, cleaning, and analysis using formulas, pivot tables, and charts__. I also learned Structured Query Language (SQL), which has empowered me to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data efficiently from relational databases. Furthermore, I am currently being taught Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool that can enabled me to visualize data and create interactive dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.
This learning journey has not only deepened my understanding of data but has also strengthened my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am excited to continue growing in this field and applying my skills to real-world challenges.*
